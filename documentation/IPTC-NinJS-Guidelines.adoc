== Introduction: ninjs is News in JSON

ninjs standardises the representation of news content in JSON, a lightweight,
easy-to-parse data interchange format. 

We have identified key properties and structures required to represent news and
publishing information, and crafted JSON representations that are designed to
result in lightweight instance documents. And we've built a JSON schema for
ninjs to help you <<How to validate objects,validate your ninjs
implementation>>.

The latest version of the standard is 1.2.

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.0.json[Version 1.0 of the ninjs
schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee on 23 October 2013.

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json[Version 1.1 of the ninjs
schema] was made available in March 2014 and an error was corrected in September
2017.

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.2.json[Version 1.2 of the ninjs
schema] was made available in October 2019.

The IPTC welcomes your feedback on how to improve the standard via the
https://groups.io/g/iptc-ninjs[public ninjs discussion group].

Staff from IPTC Member organisations are welcome to join the 
https://groups.io/g/iptc-news-in-json-dev[members-only discussion list for the
ninjs development team].

=== Built for both APIs and data at rest

In creating ninjs, we focused on two main use cases:

. *Data interchange - such as via APIs*
* ninjs documents can be very concise, allowing for the inclusion of just the
most important properties - such as byline, headline, and body text - as
determined by a given provider.
*  ninjs allows the provider to indicate whether there are more properties
available, if the recipient would like to request more.
footnote:[The provider can indicate that more properties are available using the `representationtype: "incomplete"` construct.]
. *Data at rest - such as in search engines or content management systems*
* ninjs documents can convey a rich set of news publishing properties, such as
information that is necessary for the pre-publishing workflow or custom
properties that a particular provider wants to express in a standard way.
* ninjs is designed to be customisable by a particular provider, so that they
can express just what they require, without unnecessary overhead ninjs is
suitable for use in JSON-native engines, such as
http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] or
http://www.elasticsearch.org/[Elasticsearch].

=== ninjs data model in a nutshell

As the below diagram shows, every ninjs object describes a *News Item*. All
ninjs items have a unique ID given by a *URI*. They can have administrative
metadata, describing who created the news item and when,  descriptive metadata
describing *people*, *places*, *subjects*, *organisations* and *events* related
to the news item.

The content itself can be a *body*, containing text, HTML or other
representation of the text of a news item, *renditions* of the news item as
images, videos or multimedia, or both body and renditions. *Associations* are a
means of linking news items together.

ninjs can be very simple. This is an example of something that might be returned
by an API call.

=== Renditions

The `renditions` property is a wrapper for different renditions of content of
the news object, such as articles, images, videos or PDF documents.

It contains a set of one or more keys, each with a name and an object as the
value. The name can be any text or numbers, and should represent a given
rendition type such as "thumbnail" or "preview". The object should include the
below properties.

==== Properties of renditions

[%autowidth,options="header"]
|===
|Property name|Description|Data type
|href|The URL for accessing the rendition as a resource|URI
|mimetype|A MIME type which applies to the rendition|string
|title|A title for the link to the rendition resource|string

|width|For still and moving images: the width of the display area measured in pixels|number
|sizeinbytes|The size of the rendition resource in bytes|number
|duration|The total time duration of the content in seconds|number
|format|Binary format name|string
|===

==== Renditions example

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/002_renditions_example.json[]
----

=== Associations

The `associations` property contains a set of key/value pairs where the key is
the name of the association and the value is any valid ninjs object.

This can be used to link news items together, or to associate images with a text
story, for example.

==== Associations example

This example shows a press release. The body of the story is in the `body_xhtml`
property. A logo and an image are associated to the story. Both the logo and the
image have two renditions, a "thumbnail" and a "highres" version.

[source,json]
----

----

== ninjs Examples

=== Text-only examples

==== A simple text article

Key features:

* A `uri` must be present as an identifier for this content
* `type` indicates that the generic content type is 'text'
* `byline` and `headline` are typical text news metadata
* The text of article itself is represented by `body`, in two format variants:
plain text (`body_text`) and HTML (`body_html`).

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/004_simple_text_article.json[]
----

==== A more complex example

* Metadata about the content are added to the example above.
* `person`, `place` and `organisation` employ a structure which provides human
readable names for the entity but also machine readable identifiers by the
`scheme` and `code` properties. 

[source,json]

==== More Examples on Github

You can find more examples of ninjs representations of text-based news releases
in the
https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson/tree/master/examples[ninjs Github
repository].

=== Photo-only example

A simple photo-only example.

Key features:

* A "uri" must be present
* "type" indicates that the generic content type is 'a picture'
* "byline", "headline", "description" (in plain text and HTML format) are
typical photo metadata
* The image itself is represented by "renditions". Two are available in this
example: a main version and a small version.

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/006_photo_only.json[]
----

=== Multimedia example

Example for multimedia content.

The ninjs object includes:

* text news as main object
* a main picture illustrating the text news (in ninjs terms: associated with the text news)
* a portrait of a person the text news is about (also: associated)

== ninjs Best Practices and How Tos

Here we describe some best practices for working with ninjs in your own organisation.

=== Best Practice for Naming of Properties

ninjs allows users to create their own names of extensible properties. Here we
describe some best practices for choosing your own names.

body_::
The body is the main text of the news release. The ninjs document can
contain multiple body elements, each representing the same text but in different
formats. Body elements always begin with the name "`body_`", with a tag appended
to the name. This tag should describe the format of the text in the element.
+
* You should always include a plain text body element, including the body text
stripped of all formatting: `body_text`
* For additional body elements, choose names that can be easily recognised by
automated processors, such as `body_html` and `body_xhtml`
WARNING: You should *avoid* body element names that do not describe the format of the
body text being represented, such as `body_format1` or `body_0`.

description_::
A description is a free-form textual description of the content of
the item. For example, a description can be used to add additional information
about a headline associated with a photograph. Multiple description elements can
be used to represent the same description in different formats.
+
Description elements always begin with the name "`description_`", with a tag
appended to the name. This tag should describe the format of the text in the
element.
+
When using the description_ element:
+
* Always include a plain text description element: `description_text`
* For additional description elements, choose names that can be easily recognised
by automated processors, such as `description_html` and `description_xhtml`
* You should *avoid* description element names that do not describe the format of the
description text being represented, such as `description_myformat` or
`description_0 renditions`.

renditions::
The renditions object is a wrapper for different versions of non-textual content
of the news object. This is where photographs and multimedia items will be
found.
+
Each object in the renditions object is named. Any name can be chosen for these
objects, but the name must contain only alphanumeric characters of the ASCII
character set. 

// TODO: more guidance on a naming strategy reflecting e.g. ranking and more.

associations::
The associations object is a wrapper which contains news objects (other ninjs
documents) that are associated with this news object. Any name can be chosen
for these objects, but the name must contain only alphanumeric characters of
the ASCII character set.

=== How to escape XML content for inclusion in JSON objects

JSON string values cannot contain characters: `"`, `\`, and various control
characters like tabs. Therefore, we need to escape these characters in our
content when marshaling data into JSON objects. We have provided an XSL
stylesheet to do this using XSL.

The XSL Template at
https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson/tools/xslt/nitf-to-json.xslt
extracts the body of an NITF document (NITF samples are available from
https://iptc.org/standards/nitf/using-nitf/) and creates a simple JSON object.
The resulting object is not yet a valid ninjs object, however it will be valid
JSON.

=== How to create provider-specific extensions

In some cases, your news releases may have content that does not fit into the
objects that are defined in the ninjs standard. In these cases, you should
extend (and rename) the IPTC ninjs schema.

To do this, do the following:

. make a copy of the schema file
. change the URL of the "id" property of IPTC's ninjs 1.0 ...
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
+
... to your example.com-ninjs 0.1
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ... 
+
. add your own properties to your copy of the schema. For example, to add a
sub-headline:
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
  "headline" : {
    "description" : "A brief and snappy introduction to the content, designed to
    catch the reader's attention",
    "type" : "string"
  },
  "subhead" : {
    "description" : "An additional line supporting the snappy introduction to
    the content",
    "type" : "string"
  },
  ...
+
. change the reference from the "associations" property definition
(`"$ref": "http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json#"`) to point to
your new schema:
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
  "associations" : {
    "description" : "Content of news objects which are associated
    with this news object",
    "type" : "object",
    "additionalProperties" : false,
    "patternProperties" : {
      "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+" :  {
        "$ref": "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#"
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
+
. save your new schema to a location where users of the schema can access it,
which should be the same URL used for the "id" property and the "$ref" property
of the "associations" definition (this is used for validating that an associated
object is a complete ninjs document and this is how the schema knows to
recursively validate associated objects):
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
}
+
the file should be saved to: http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json

This is an example ninjs document that includes a sub-headline in an extended
ninjs document:

=== How to validate objects

==== Validating a ninjs document

JSON Schema is the de-facto standard for validating JSON documents. The IPTC
maintains schemas for each version of the ninjs standard. These schemas can be
used to validate ninjs documents. 

This is the latest IPTC ninjs schema available for download:
https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json

==== Sample Code

Sample code demonstrating how to validate ninjs documents, along with example
ninjs documents, can be found in the https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson[IPTC newsinjson github repository].

==== Online Validator

You can also validate ninjs documents by pasting the schema and document into
this online validator, which is built on the json-schema-validator library:

http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com

== Mapping between ninjs and NewsML-G2

ninjs and NewsML-G2 are not intended to be equivalent to each other, but they
both adhere to the IPTC News Architecture, so they share many properties.

Here is a summary of the properties shared by ninjs and NewsML-G2:

== ninjs Revision History

=== ninjs 1.0

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.0.json[Version 1.0 of the ninjs
schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee on 23 October 2013.

=== ninjs 1.1

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json[Version 1.1 of the ninjs
schema] was made available in March 2014.

Version 1.1 moved to JSON Schema version 4, and added the `urgency`,
`usageterms` and `geometry_*` properties.

An error in the association reference URI was corrected in September 2017.

== Additional Resources

=== On the Web

The IPTC web site www.iptc.org has a wealth of resources for implementers. The
page www.iptc.org/standards summarises all of the IPTC's standards and provides
links to further resources for each, including ninjs, NewsML-G2, SportsML-G2 and
RightsML.

There are also user groups at Groups.io for all those seeking answers to
questions about ninjs or other IPTC standards, and for those who would like to
participate in development work:

https://groups.io/g/iptc-ninjs/ is the public group for discussing ninjs and
other representations of news content in the JSON format.

=== Join the IPTC

The IPTC welcomes new members. Membership is the backbone of the IPTC, and
levels vary for both organisations and individuals. Additionally, several
"working parties" and "working groups" focus on specific topic areas and
standards. IPTC also hosts two face-to-face meetings a year around the globe,
where its working parties discuss and develop their ideas to support information
exchange and the rapid innovation of media.

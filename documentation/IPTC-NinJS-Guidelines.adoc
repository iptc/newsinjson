== Introduction: ninjs is News in JSON

ninjs standardises the representation of news content in JSON, a lightweight,
easy-to-parse data interchange format. 

We have identified key properties and structures required to represent news and
publishing information, and crafted JSON representations that are designed to
result in lightweight instance documents. While keeping it simple, we have been
careful to map ninjs concepts to the IPTC News Architecture, so you can rest
assured that ninjs concepts can interoperate with other markup languages such
as https://iptc.org/standards/newsml-g2/[NewsML-G2].

To help get you started, we have created a
https://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/generator/[simple ninjs generator] so you can see
how simple a real ninjs document can be. We have also built a JSON schema for
ninjs to help you <<How to validate objects,validate your ninjs implementation>>.

The latest version of the standard is 1.3: 
https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.3.json[Version 1.3 of the ninjs
schema] was made available in May 2020.

The IPTC welcomes your feedback on how to improve the standard via the
https://groups.io/g/iptc-ninjs[public ninjs discussion group]. You can also add
and comment on issues in the
https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson[news in json github repository]. Staff from
IPTC Member organisations are welcome to join the 
https://groups.io/g/iptc-news-in-json-dev[members-only discussion list for the
ninjs development team].

=== Built for both APIs and data at rest

In creating ninjs, we focused on two main use cases:

. *Data interchange - such as via APIs*
* ninjs documents can be very concise, allowing for the inclusion of just the most important properties - such as byline, headline, and body text - as determined by a given provider.
*  ninjs allows the provider to indicate whether there are more properties available, if the recipient would like to request more.
footnote:[The provider can indicate that more properties are available using the `representationtype: "incomplete"` construct.]
. *Data at rest - such as in search engines or content management systems*
* ninjs documents can convey a rich set of news publishing properties, such as information that is necessary for the pre-publishing workflow or custom properties that a particular provider wants to express in a standard way.
* ninjs is designed to be customisable by a particular provider, so that they can express just what they require, without unnecessary overhead. Ninjs is suitable for use in JSON-native engines, such as http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] or
http://www.elasticsearch.org/[Elasticsearch].

=== ninjs data model in a nutshell

As the below diagram shows, every ninjs object describes a *News Item*. All ninjs items must have a unique ID given by a *URI*. They can have administrative metadata, describing who created the news item and when, descriptive metadata describing *people*, *places*, *subjects*, *organisations* and *events* related
to the news item.

The content itself can be a *body*, containing text, HTML or other representation of the text of a news item, *renditions* of the news item as images, videos or multimedia, or both body and renditions. *Associations* are a means of linking news items together.

=== A simple example

ninjs can be very simple. This is an example of something that might be returned by an API call.

You can make your own simple ninjs document using the
https://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/generator/[ninjs generator tool on iptc.org].

=== ninjs and other standards

JSON is an increasingly popular

(or
http://blog.appfog.com/why-json-will-continue-to-push-xml-out-of-the-picture/[replacement for]) XML. ninjs is designed to be used alongside other https://iptc.org/standards/[IPTC formats], including https://iptc.org/standards/newsml-g2/[NewsML-G2],
https://iptc.org/standards/iptc-7901/[IPTC7901] and https://iptc.org/standards/rnews/[rNews].

|===

=== Renditions

The `renditions` property is a wrapper for different renditions of content of the news object, such as articles, images, videos or PDF documents.

It contains a set of one or more keys, each with a name and an object as the value. The name can be any text or numbers, and should represent a given rendition type such as "thumbnail" or "preview". The object should include the below properties.

==== Properties of renditions

[%autowidth,options="header"]
|===
|Property name|Description|Data type
|href|The URL for accessing the rendition as a resource|URI
|mimetype|A MIME type which applies to the rendition|string
|title|A title for the link to the rendition resource|string
|height|For still and moving images: the height of the display area measured in pixels|number
|width|For still and moving images: the width of the display area measured in pixels|number
|sizeinbytes|The size of the rendition resource in bytes|number
|duration|The total time duration of the content in seconds|number
|format|Binary format name|string
|===

==== Renditions example

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/002_renditions_example.json[]
----

=== Associations

The `associations` property contains a set of key/value pairs where the key is the name of the association and the value is any valid ninjs object.

This can be used to link news items together, or to associate images with a text story, for example.

==== Associations example

This example shows a press release. The body of the story is in the `body_xhtml` property. A logo and an image are associated to the story. Both the logo and the image have two renditions, a "thumbnail" and a "highres" version.

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/003_associations_example.json[]
----

== ninjs Examples

=== Text-only examples

==== A simple text article

Key features:

* A `uri` must be present as an identifier for this content
* `type` indicates that the generic content type is 'text'
* `byline` and `headline` are typical text news metadata
* The text of article itself is represented by `body`, in two format variants: plain text (`body_text`) and HTML (`body_html`).

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/004_simple_text_article.json[]
----

==== A more complex example

* Metadata about the content are added to the example above.
* `person`, `place` and `organisation` employ a structure which provides human readable names for the entity but also machine readable identifiers by the `scheme` and `code` properties. 

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/005_complex_text_article.json[]

==== More Examples on GitHub

You can find more examples of ninjs representations of text-based news releases in the https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson/tree/master/examples[ninjs GitHub
repository].

=== Photo-only example

A simple photo-only example.

Key features:

* A "uri" must be present
* "type" indicates that the generic content type is 'a picture'
* "byline", "headline", "description" (in plain text and HTML format) are typical photo metadata
* The image itself is represented by "renditions". Two are available in this example: a main version and a small version.

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/006_photo_only.json[]
----

=== Multimedia example

Example for multimedia content.

The ninjs object includes:

* text news as main object
* a main picture illustrating the text news (in ninjs terms: associated with the text news)
* a portrait of a person the text news is about (also: associated)

== ninjs Best Practices and How Tos

Here we describe some best practices for working with ninjs in your own organisation.

=== Best Practice for Naming of Properties

ninjs allows users to create their own names of extensible properties. Here we describe some best practices for choosing your own names.

body_::
The body is the main text of the news release. The ninjs document can contain multiple body elements, each representing the same text but in different formats. Body elements always begin with the name "`body_`", with a tag appended to the name. This tag should describe the format of the text in the element.
+
* You should always include a plain text body element, including the body text stripped of all formatting: `body_text`
* For additional body elements, choose names that can be easily recognised by automated processors, such as `body_html` and `body_xhtml`
WARNING: You should *avoid* body element names that do not describe the format of the body text being represented, such as `body_format1` or `body_0`.

description_::
A description is a free-form textual description of the content of the item. For example, a description can be used to add additional information about a headline associated with a photograph. Multiple description elements can be used to represent the same description in different formats.
+
Description elements always begin with the name "`description_`", with a tag appended to the name. This tag should describe the format of the text in the element.
+
When using the description_ element:
+
* Always include a plain text description element: `description_text`
* For additional description elements, choose names that can be easily recognised by automated processors, such as `description_html` and `description_xhtml`
* You should *avoid* description element names that do not describe the format of the description text being represented, such as `description_myformat` or `description_0 renditions`.

renditions::
The renditions object is a wrapper for different versions of the content of the news object. This is where photographs and multimedia items will be found. Or other textual variants.
+
Each object in the renditions object is named. Any name can be chosen for these objects, but the name must contain only alphanumeric characters of the ASCII character set. 

// TODO: more guidance on a naming strategy reflecting e.g. ranking and more.

associations::
The associations object is a wrapper which contains news objects (other ninjs documents) that are associated with this news object. Any name can be chosen for these objects, but the name must contain only alphanumeric characters of the ASCII character set.

==== Pattern properties

Several properties in ninjs is defined through a pattern that can look something like this: `"^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"` or `"^body_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"`
The intention of these patterns is to restrict the naming of property names. But to be complete they should have a trailing $, like `"^body_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"`. With that missing it is possible to construct a name that breaks the intention of the pattern but is still valid. Users of ninjs are encouraged to use the patterns as intended. IPTC will update this in future revisions to ninjs.

=== How to escape XML content for inclusion in JSON objects

JSON string values cannot contain characters: `"`, `\`, and various control characters like tabs. Therefore, we need to escape these characters in our content when marshaling data into JSON objects. We have provided an XSL stylesheet to do this using XSL.

The XSL Template at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iptc/newsinjson/master/tools/xslt/nitf-to-json.xslt
extracts the body of an NITF document (NITF samples are available from https://iptc.org/standards/nitf/using-nitf/) and creates a simple JSON object.
The resulting object is not yet a valid ninjs object, however it will be valid JSON.

=== How to create provider-specific extensions

In some cases, your news releases may have content that does not fit into the objects that are defined in the ninjs standard. In these cases, you should extend (and rename) the IPTC ninjs schema.

To do this, do the following:

. make a copy of the schema file
. change the URL of the "id" property of IPTC's ninjs 1.3 ...
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.3.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
+
to your example.com-ninjs 0.1
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ... 
+
. add your own properties to your copy of the schema. For example, to add a sub-headline:
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
  "headline" : {
    "description" : "A brief and snappy introduction to the content, designed to
    catch the reader's attention",
    "type" : "string"
  },
  "subhead" : {
    "description" : "An additional line supporting the snappy introduction to the content",
    "type" : "string"
  },
  ...
+
. change the reference from the "associations" property definition
(`"$ref": "http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.3.json#"`) to point to
your new schema:
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
  "associations" : {
    "description" : "Content of news objects which are associated
    with this news object",
    "type" : "object",
    "additionalProperties" : false,
    "patternProperties" : {
      "^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+": {
        "$ref": "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#"
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
+
. save your new schema to a location where users of the schema can access it, which should be the same URL used for the "id" property and the "$ref" property of the "associations" definition (this is used for validating that an associated
object is a complete ninjs document and this is how the schema knows to recursively validate associated objects):
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
}
+
the file should be saved to: http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json

This is an example ninjs document that includes a sub-headline in an extended ninjs document:

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/not-valid/008_extension.json[]
----

==== Using $standard

With the ninjs 1.3 addition of $standard providers can indicate in each json-file exactly which schema the file is valid against. So for the above example of extending the schema that could be shown like this:

=== How to validate objects

==== Validating a ninjs document

JSON Schema is the de-facto standard for validating JSON documents. The IPTC maintains schemas for each version of the ninjs standard. These schemas can be used to validate ninjs documents. 

This is the latest IPTC ninjs schema available for download:
https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.3.json

==== Sample Code

Sample code demonstrating how to validate ninjs documents, along with example ninjs documents, can be found in the https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson[IPTC newsinjson github repository].

==== Online Validator

You can also validate ninjs documents by pasting the schema and document into this online validator, which is built on the json-schema-validator library:

== Mapping between ninjs and NewsML-G2

ninjs and NewsML-G2 are not intended to be equivalent to each other, but they both adhere to the IPTC News Architecture, so they share many properties.

Here is a summary of the properties shared by ninjs and NewsML-G2:

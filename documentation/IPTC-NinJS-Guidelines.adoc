== Introduction: ninjs is News in JSON

ninjs standardises the representation of news content in JSON, a lightweight,
easy-to-parse data interchange format. 

We have identified key properties and structures required to represent news and
publishing information, and crafted JSON representations that are designed to
result in lightweight instance documents. While keeping it simple, we have been
careful to map ninjs concepts to the IPTC News Architecture, so you can rest
assured that ninjs concepts can interoperate with other markup languages such
as https://iptc.org/standards/newsml-g2/[NewsML-G2].

We have created some tools to help get users started. These include a
https://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/generator/[simple ninjs generator] that shows
how easily a real ninjs document can be created, and a <<Validating a ninjs document,JSON schema to validate ninjs objects>>.

The latest version of the standard is 2.1. 
https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_2.1.json[Version 2.1 of the ninjs
schema] was made available in June 2023.

The latest version in the 1.x branch is 1.5, which was made avaialble in June 2023.
See below for more information on the <<Differences between ninjs 1.x and 2.x,differences between the 1.x and 2.x branches>>.

=== Built for both APIs and data at rest

In creating ninjs, we focused on two main use cases:

. *Data interchange - such as via APIs*
* ninjs documents can be very concise, allowing for the inclusion of just the
most important properties - such as byline, headline, and body text - as
determined by a given provider.
* ninjs allows the provider to indicate whether there are more properties
available, if the recipient would like to request more, using the
`representationtype: "partial"` construct.
* Starting from version 2.0, the ninjs schema has been created in such a way
that it can easily be converted into a schema for a binary data serialisation
protocol such as https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protocol
Buffers], https://avro.apache.org/[Avro], https://thrift.apache.org/[Thrift] or
https://cbor.io/[CBOR] / https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610[CDDL]. We
include a Protocol Buffers schema as an example.
. *Data at rest - such as in search engines or content management systems*
* ninjs documents can convey a rich set of news publishing properties, such as
information that is necessary for the pre-publishing workflow or custom
properties that a particular provider wants to express in a standard way.
* ninjs is designed to be customisable by a particular provider, so that they
can express just what they require, without unnecessary overhead. Ninjs is
suitable for use in JSON-native engines, such as
http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] or
http://www.elasticsearch.org/[Elasticsearch].

=== ninjs data model in a nutshell

As the below diagram shows, every ninjs object describes a *News Item*. All
ninjs items must have a unique ID given by a *URI*. They can have administrative
metadata, describing who created the news item and when, descriptive metadata
describing *people*, *places*, *genres*, *subjects*, *organisations* and
*events* related to the news item.

The content itself can be a *body*, containing text, HTML or other
representation of the text of a news item, *renditions* of the news item as
images, videos or multimedia, or both body and renditions. *Associations* are a
means of linking news items together.

=== A simple example
ninjs can be very simple. This is an example of something that might be returned
by an API call.

[source,json]

You can make your own simple ninjs document using the
https://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/generator/[ninjs generator tool on iptc.org].

=== Two versions of ninjs: ninjs 1.5 and ninjs 2.1

IPTC manages two current versions of ninjs: the 2.x branch (where the latest
version is 2.1) and the 1.x branch (where the latest version is currently
1.5).

The 1.x series continues the version of ninjs that started with ninjs 1.0 in
2013, adding new features in a way that is fully backwardscompatible. The
latest release in this series is 1.5, which includes new properties such as
`contactinfo`, `symbol` and `symboltype` (<<ninjs 1.5,see the full list of
changes>>). 

The 2.x series fixes some issues that made the 1.x series tricky for some
developers to work with. The main change is that ninjs 2.x avoids the use of
patternProperties, so all properties now have well-defined names. This change
is intended to make ninjs easier for projects based on binary protocols such as
Protocol Buffers and Avro. We also took the opportunity to make property names
more consistent with NewsML-G2 and to add some fields to handle rights.

We wanted to issue a new release which fixed these problems, but this meant
breaking backwards compatibility with the 1.x versions of ninjs.  This is why
we decided to maintain two parallel branches: 1.x and 2.x.

All new users are strongly recommended to use version 2.1.

The 2.1 and 1.5 versions of ninjs were approved by the IPTC Standards Committee
on May 17th, 2023.

This document focuses on the 2.1 version, but those who must use version 1.5
for backwards compatibility reasons can find the JSON Schema file for ninjs 1.5
schema at https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.5.json.

=== Differences between ninjs 1.x and 2.x

We maintain the 1.x branch for those who can't move to the new structure in 2.0.
Most of the properties are the same as the ones in ninjs 2.x, with the exception
of the multi-valued properties.

==== patternProperties converted to arrays

Some properties are implemented as "patternProperties" in the 1.x JSON Schema,
which means that the name must start with a certain text string (such as `headline_`) but can end in any string (such as `subhead`).
This can be used to distinguish objects from each other. In the 2.x version of the schema,
we converted them to be simple arrays with well-defined names, and a `role` property
that defines the type of the value.

For example, a subheadline is defined in ninjs 1.x as

[source,ninjs 1.x JSON]
----
{
  "headline_subhead": "My subheadline"
}
----

The same subheadline would be defined in ninjs 2.x as

[source,ninjs 2.x JSON]
----
{
  "headlines": [
    {
      "role": "subhead",
      "value": "My subheadline"
    }
  ]
}
----

This applies to the following properties:

*  `description_XXX` (1.x) / `descriptions` (2.x)
* `body_XXX` (1.x) / `bodies` (2.x)
* `headline_XXX` (1.x) / `headlines` (2.x)

==== Renditions and Associations converted to arrays

The `renditions` and `associations` properties are arrays in ninjs 2.x and objects in ninjs 1.x.

In ninjs 1.x a rendition may look like the following:

[source,ninjs 1.x JSON]
----
{
  "renditions": {
    "highres": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
----

The same rendition in ninjs 2.x would look like:

[source,ninjs 2.x JSON]
----
{
  "renditions": [
    {
      "name": "highres",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
----

Associations work the same way in both ninjs 1.x and ninjs 2.x.

==== Property names converted to plural form

In addition, the following property names were converted to plural form for ninjs 2.x.
They were not changed in any other way.

* `altid` (ninjs 1.x) / `altids` (ninjs 2.x)
* `event` (ninjs 1.x) / `events` (ninjs 2.x)
* `genre` (ninjs 1.x) / `genres` (ninjs 2.x)
* `infosource` (ninjs 1.x) / `infosources` (ninjs 2.x)
* `object` (ninjs 1.x) / `objects` (ninjs 2.x)
* `organisation` (ninjs 1.x) / `organisations` (ninjs 2.x)
* `person` (ninjs 1.x) / `people` (ninjs 2.x)
* `place` (ninjs 1.x) / `places` (ninjs 2.x)
* `subject` (ninjs 1.x) / `subjects` (ninjs 2.x) and
* `trustindicator` (ninjs 1.x) / `trustindicators` (ninjs 2.x).

=== Which version of ninjs should I choose for my project?

If you are starting a green-field project, we recommend using the latest
version in the ninjs 2.x branch: currently ninjs 2.1.  This version should be
easiest for developers to work with.

If you are already using a 1.x version of ninjs, we recommend at least
upgrading to the latest version in the 1.x branch, currently 1.5. This should
be an easy change, because 1.5 is backwards-compatible with earlier 1.x versions.

=== ninjs and other standards

=== Associations

The `associations` property contains associated valid ninjs objects, each with a *required* `name` explaining the nature of the association.

This can be used to link news items together, or to associate images with a text story, for example.

==== Associations example

This example shows a press release. The body of the story is in the single object in the `bodies` property. A logo and an image are associated to the story. Both the logo and the image have two renditions, a "thumbnail" and a "highres" version.

== ninjs Examples

=== Text-only examples

==== A simple text article

Key features:

* A `uri` must be present as an identifier for this content
* `type` indicates that the generic content type is 'text'
* `by` and `headlines` are typical text news metadata
* The text of article itself is represented by `bodies`, in two format variants: plain text and HTML.

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/004_simple_text_article.json[]
----

==== A more complex example

* Metadata about the content are added to the example above.
* `person`, `place` and `organisation` employ a structure which provides human readable names for the entity but also machine readable identifiers by the `scheme` and `code` properties.

==== More Examples on GitHub

You can find more examples of ninjs representations of text-based news releases
in the https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson/tree/main/examples[ninjs GitHub
repository].

=== Photo-only example

A simple photo-only example.

Key features:

* A "uri" must be present
* "type" indicates that the generic content type is 'a picture'
* "by", "headlines", "descriptions" (in plain text and HTML format) are typical photo metadata
* The image itself is represented by "renditions". Two are available in this example: a main version and a small version.

=== Multimedia example

Example for multimedia content.

The ninjs object includes:

* text news as main object
* a main picture illustrating the text news (in ninjs terms: associated with the text news)
* a portrait of a person the text news is about (also: associated)

== ninjs Best Practices and How Tos

Here we describe some best practices for working with ninjs in your own organisation.

=== Best Practice for identifying objects in arrays

The first generation of ninjs used patternproperties to identify and name bodies, headlines etc. With 2.0 these are now arrays of objects. If you, for example, only have one headline you only need to use the value property. If there are more than one headline you can use the role and/or contenttype properties to convey to the receivers of your items what each object is meant for and what format it has.

=== How to escape XML content for inclusion in JSON objects

JSON string values cannot contain characters: `"`, `\`, and various control characters like tabs. Therefore, we need to escape these characters in our content when marshaling data into JSON objects. We have provided an XSL stylesheet to do this using XSL.

The XSL Template at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iptc/newsinjson/master/tools/xslt/nitf-to-json.xslt
extracts the body of an NITF document (NITF samples are available from https://iptc.org/standards/nitf/using-nitf/) and creates a simple JSON object.
The resulting object is not yet a valid ninjs object, however it will be valid JSON.

=== How to create provider-specific extensions

In some cases, your news releases may have content that does not fit into the
objects that are defined in the ninjs standard. In these cases, you can (and
should) copy and extend the IPTC ninjs schema.

To do this, do the following:

. make a copy of the schema file
. change the URL of the "id" property of IPTC's ninjs 2.1 ...
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "id" : "http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_2.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
+
to your own ID, for example `example.com-ninjs-0.1`:
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/extended-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ... 
+
. add your own properties to your copy of the schema. For example, to add a
property explaining the reason for an embargo:
+
[source,json]
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "id" : "http://www.example.com/extended-ninjs-schema_0.1.json#",
  "type" : "object",
  ...
  "embargoed": {
    "title": "Embargoed",
    "description": "The date and time before which all versions of the news object are embargoed. If absent, this object is not embargoed. nar:embargoed",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "date-time"
  },
  "embargoedreason" : {
    "description" : "Textual description of why article is embargoed.",
    "type" : "string"
  },
  ...
+
. save your new schema to a location where users of the schema can access it,
which should be the same as the URL used for the "id" property. For the example
above, the file should be accessible at
http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json

This is an example ninjs document that includes the added property giving the
reason for the embargo in an extended ninjs document:

[source,json]
----
include::includes/examples/not-valid/008_extension.json[]
----

==== Using `standard`

With the `standard` field, providers can indicate in each JSON file exactly
which schema the file is valid against. So the above example of extending the
schema could be shown like this:

[source,json]
{
  "uri": "http://ninjs.example.com/newsitems/20130709simp123",
  "standard": {
      "name": "e-ninjs-schema",
      "schema" : "http://www.example.com/e-ninjs-schema_0.1.json",
      "version" : "0.1"
  },
  "type": "text",
  "versioncreated": "2013-07-09T10:37:00Z",
  "embargoed": "2013-07-09T14:00:00Z",
  "embargoedreason": "The nomination is made public at this time."
  ...
}

== Tools for developing with ninjs

=== Validating a ninjs document

JSON Schema is the de-facto standard for validating JSON documents. The IPTC
maintains schemas for each version of the ninjs standard. These schemas can be
used to validate ninjs documents. 

The latest IPTC ninjs schema is available for download at
https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_2.1.json

=== Sample Code

Sample code demonstrating how to validate ninjs documents, along with example
ninjs documents, can be found in the
https://github.com/iptc/newsinjson[IPTC newsinjson github repository].

=== Online "ninjs generator" tool

The IPTC has created a simple form-based tool that can be used to generate
sample ninjs documents. It supports both ninjs 1.5 and ninjs 2.1.

The tool can be accessed at https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/generator/.

=== TypeScript type definition

Ian Young of PA Media Group has created a 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pa-media-group/iptc-ninjs-2-type[TypeScript type for ninjs 2] that can be used to ease development with ninjs in TypeScript.

== Mapping between ninjs and NewsML-G2

ninjs and NewsML-G2 are not intended to be equivalent to each other, but they
both adhere to the https://www.iptc.org/standards/news-architecture/[IPTC News
Architecture], so they share many properties.

Here is a summary of the properties shared by ninjs and NewsML-G2:

== ninjs Revision History

=== ninjs 1.0

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.0.json[Version 1.0 of the ninjs schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee on 23 October 2013.

=== ninjs 1.1

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json[Version 1.1 of the ninjs schema] was made available in March 2014.

Version 1.1 moved to JSON Schema version 4, and added the `urgency`, `usageterms` and `geometry_*` properties.

An error in the association reference URI in the version 1.1 JSON Schema document was corrected in September 2017.

=== ninjs 1.2

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.2.json[Version 1.2 of the ninjs schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee and made available in October 2019.

Version 1.2 added the `firstcreated`, `charcount`, `wordcount`, `slugline`, `ednote`, `infosource`, `title` and `slugline` properties. It also added the value `component` under type. It changed the description of the `renditions` property and added sub-properties `duration` and `format`.

=== ninjs 1.3

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.3.json[Version 1.3 of the ninjs schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee and made available in May 2020.

Version 1.3 added the `headline_`, `altids`, `trustindicator`, `$standard` and `genre` properties. 

=== ninjs 1.4

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.4.json[Version 1.4 of the ninjs schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee in May 2022. It contains new fields _contentcreated_, _expires_ and _rightsinfo_.

=== ninjs 1.5

https://iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.5.json[Version 1.5 of the ninjs schema] was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee in May 2023.

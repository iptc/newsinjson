The sole defendant, Francesco Schettino, his eyes shaded by sunglasses and slipping into a back door, made no comment to reporters as he arrived for his trial Tuesday on charges of multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing the shipwreck near the island of Giglio. His lawyer, Domenico Pepe, told reporters that, as expected, the judge was postponing the hearing due to an eight-day nationwide lawyers' strike. Pepe said some 1,000 witnesses are expected to eventually testify. Many of them are expected to be from among the 4,200 passengers and crew aboard the ship that struck a jagged reef off Giglio, took on water and capsized. Schettino has denied wrongdoing."

# ninjs Examples

There are three folders of examples:

In 2.0 you can find samples with various purposes and from different providers following the 2.0 schema.
(The providers do not use 2.0 so the samples have been manually converted to illustrate the 2.0 version.)

In 1.3 we have collected samples from various providers to illustrate the 1.3 version of ninjs.

The NewsML folder hold some xml samples that were converted to ninjs 1.3.


The latest ninjs specification file is available in JSON schema format at

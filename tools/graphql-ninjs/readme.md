# Example of using graphQL with some sample ninjs objects

This is not a complete solution for setting up a graphQL server to serve ninjs content. But it is a test to show how you can use graphQL to filter and adjust the ninjs-data returned.
In a more realistic setup you would need to add support to connect to the database where the ninjs objects are stored.

## Starting the server
1) Clone or copy this repo to your local machine.
2) Open a terminal window and move to the tools/graphql-ninjs folder.
3) Run npm install
4) Type npm run dev 
5) and you should get this line: "Running GraphQL on localhost:4001/graphql"

## Open graphQL testscreen
1) Open a browser
2) Go to http://localhost:4001/graphql
3) If it all worked you should see a testing interface for graphQL

## Testing graphQL
1) Start with {ninjs {uri}} and press the round RUN-button with the arrow. You should see a list of uri's from ninjs-items.
2) You can try to add other properties. The screen has some intellisense and uses the schema to show possible choises as you type.
3) Add more properties to your search:
{ninjs {
  uri
  pubstatus
  language
  headline
}
}
Will show these four properties for each ninjs item.

4) If you want to filter the result you can add that in parenteses after ninjs:
{ninjs (pubstatus: "usable", language: "sv") {
  uri
  pubstatus
  language
  headline
}
}
Will only show the usable items that is in Swedish.





The samples in the data.json come from TT, NTB, DPA and AP. They have been adapted to fit the ninjs 1.2 schema.

# Demo of typescript unit based on ninjs 2.0 schema

##Compiling

compile.ts use the json-schema-to-typescript module to create the ts unit.
This does not have to be done each time since the ninjs20.ts already exist.


##Usage

The ninjs20.ts file can be used from any typescript project to assist in building a ninjs item.


##Testing

To illustrate this you can run ts-node test to run this file. It will read a NewsML file and then run the converter to convert this xml to ninjs.

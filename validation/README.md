# Validation

ninjs documents can be validated using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).

The IPTC maintains a schema for each release of the ninjs standard. IPTC ninjs
schemas can be found [here](http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/).

The most recent ninjs specification file is available at
http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.1.json

# Test Suite

The `validation/test_suite` folder contains basic test documents that exercise
the capabilities of ninjs, and ensure that the schema correctly validates the
properties defined in ninjs.

## Running the test suite

* Install Python 3
* From a command line, run

    $ pip3 install jsonschema
    $ validation/python/runtests.py

This will run each of the files in the test suite against the ninjs-1.0 and
ninjs-1.1 schemas.

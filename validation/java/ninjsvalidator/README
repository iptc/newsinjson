This example program shows how to use the json-schema-validator library (https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator)
to validate ninjs documents.

BUILDING
========
ninjsvalidator is built using Maven. Just execute the package goal:

mvn package


RUNNING
=======
You can use the provided script to execute the program:
cd src/main/scripts
./validator file1...


CLASSES
=======
ValidatorMain is the main class.

Validator is the class where validation is done. To use Validator in your own programs:

Validator validator = new Validator();
ProcessingReport report = validator.validate(new File(filename));
if (report.isSuccess()) {
	// successful
} else {
	// failed to validate
}

You can also pass URL's and entire ninjs documents to the Validator instance for validation.


TESTS
=====
The src/test/java directory contains JUnit tests. These tests check that a valid document passes
validation, and that an invalid document fails validation. The JUnit tests are used to test the
code when changes are made. You probably don't need to worry about them if you are just trying
to validate ninjs documents.


CHANGES
=======
Version 1.1
	Add a Main class and a script
	Add README
